## Coding Guidlines

- Any function used within only one function body should be placed in a '''where''' clause, unless its unreadable. Simply because a function is general. Cluttering up top level definitions is messy. 
- Don't worry about eta reduction in places in a function if it assists readability.
- Comments should be used at necessary toplevel functions, and ocasionally in large function bodies. Generally, no narration.


- Function names with an prefix underscore ('_') indicate they are 'incomplete' versions of other, locally defined functions. We mean that such a function is not often directly used but needs to be written as top level function. Done for name space reasons as well as readability reasons.

## Imports

Unfortunately, there is still the antiquated "Prelude" to deal with.  
-- Rule of thumb [I]: don't include an explicit import list
--- Exception: name clash.
---------if its in the prelude. hide it or import qualified from prelude.
-- Rule of thumb [II]: avoid qualified imports
That doesn't say no qualified imports. s



## Language Extensions
These following languages are used by nearly every source file and should be included in the 'extensions' section of the .cabal file:
- NoImplicitPrelude
- OverloadedStrings
We have made a custom prelude all files import. These are all considered 'safe' in the community sense of being well tested and they dont introduce any type-system breaking effects. The following are 

- TupleSections
